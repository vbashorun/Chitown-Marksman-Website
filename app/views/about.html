    <p>Your Friendly Neighborhood Photographer</p>
    
    <p>Hey! my name is Victor and Iâ€™m a web developer and freelance photographer currently 
    based in California Bay Area. I started my professional photography journey around Januaury 
    of 2016. I shoot all kinds of things but my preferences lie within lifestyle, urban/street 
    fashion, creative/concept portraiture, and urban exploration photography.</p>
